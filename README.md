## Development

Please read [Contribuition guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md), and
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (latest stable)

Other:

* JDK 11 or later if you're gonna build for Android
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) if you're gonna build for iOS/macOS
* To run tests on your machine, see [Testing](#testing)

Building for Windows, macOS, and Linux-based systems requires the same
dependencies as Flutter. Read more on <https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration>

### Testing

If you plan to run tests on your machine, ensure you've installed ObjectBox
dynamic libraries.

Install ObjectBox dynamic libraries[^3]:

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)`

Run tests with: `flutter test`

## Support Flow

Flow is a personal project developed during my free time, and it generates no
income. Consider helping Flow! Here are some suggestions:

* Give a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/flow-mn/flow)
* Leave a review on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.flow.flow)
  and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/mn/app/flow-expense-tracker/id6477741670)
* Tell a friend
* [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/sadespresso)

Maintaining Flow on the App Store requires a substantial annual fee
(see [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/support/enrollment/#:~:text=The%20Apple%20Developer%20Program%20annual,in%20local%20currency%20where%20available.)),
which [I currently cover](https://github.com/sadespresso).  To ensure Flow's
continued existence and future development, your support is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all the contributors, supporters, testers, and those who
indirectly contributed 🤍

to enhance the UI for desktop experience for now.
